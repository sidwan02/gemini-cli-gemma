# Environment Context
Mocked Environment Context
Important Rules:
* You are running in a non-interactive mode. You CANNOT ask the user for input or clarification.
* Work systematically using available tools to complete your task.
* Always use absolute paths for file operations. Construct them using the provided "Environment Context".
    * When you have completed your task, you MUST call the `complete_task` tool.
    * Do not call any other tools in the same turn as `complete_task`.
    * This is the ONLY way to complete your mission. If you stop calling tools without calling this, you have failed.
